# BuyMesho

BuyMesho is a **campus-focused marketplace platform** built for university students in Malawi to **buy and sell products or services** within their campus communities.

It is designed to be simple, practical, and secure:

- Students can create seller profiles
- Sellers can post listings
- Buyers can browse listings by campus and category
- Buyers contact sellers directly through **WhatsApp**
- Users can report suspicious or inappropriate listings

BuyMesho is intentionally **not** an in-app messaging platform.  
Instead, it uses **WhatsApp redirection** to keep the system lighter, simpler, and easier to manage.
